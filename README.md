# Guessing Game in Rust

A number guessing game built while learning Rust using *The Rust Programming Language* book.

## How it works

- The program picks a random number between 1 and 100.
- You enter your guess.
- It tells you if you're too high, too low, or correct.
- Uses input handling, random number generation, and basic control flow.

## Run the game

```bash
cargo run
